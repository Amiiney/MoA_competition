# MoA_competition
The solution of the mechanism of action prediction competition on kaggle. **The models in this repository work perfectly with tabular data with multi-label targets**

## BLOG POST: 

A summary of the Mechanisms of action (MoA) prediction competition on kaggle where we used deep learning algorithms to predict the MoA of newÂ drugs. This repository includes the models, training pipeline, weights and inference pipeline.

## Models:
> ### 1- Multi layer perceptron:
![alt text](URL)
Parameters: Adam optimizer, Reduce on plateau scheduler and a binary cross-entropy BCE With Logits Loss function that includes a sigmoid activation.

> ### 2- TabNet:
TabNet is a deep learning model for tabular data. TabNet combines the properties of neural networks and tree-based algorithms.

> ### 3- DeepInsight image transformation + EfficientNet B4
Tabular data is transformed to t-SNE image data and fed to an efficientNet B4 model.
